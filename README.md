# Blinkit Sales Data Analysis (Demo Project)

This project is a **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project** on a Blinkit demo sales dataset.  
The analysis is done entirely using **Python (Pandas library)** without any external BI tools.


##  Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data (remove duplicates, format columns, handle missing values).
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify **sales trends, repeat customers, and high-value customers**.
- Answer 10 business-related questions using only **Python + Pandas**.


##  Key Analysis & Questions Solved
1. How many orders are placed **daily**?
2. How many orders are placed **weekly**?
3. Which day has the **highest number of orders**?
4. What are the **Top 5 highest selling products** month-wise?
5. How many **unique customers** are in the dataset?
6. How many times each **customer has visited / ordered**?
7. How many **repeat customers** (who ordered more than once) exist?
8. List of **repeat customers (Top 10 IDs)**.
9. Who are the **Top 10 High-Value Customers** based on spending?
10. Compare **monthly sales trends of Top 5 products**.
